For this collection of individuals, success came as a secondary result of their passion to pursue scholarship, philanthropy, athletics, and spirituality. The pinnacle of their achievements was recognized by the International Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta in their awarding of the Baker Cup (â€˜05-â€˜06), Condon Cup (â€™05-â€™06), and Jordan Bowl (â€™04-â€™06).\n\nAt a prestigious institution and such quality of a fraternity system, Gamma Tau was also recognized by the Georgia Tech Interfraternity Council in receiving its highest honor in 2007 and 2010, the Dean Dull Award. The Dean Dull Award is granted to the fraternity that scores best overall in seven categories: Scholarship, Leadership, Philanthropy, Intramurals, Greek Week, Homecoming, and Educational Programming.\n\nOn campus, Gamma Tau is known to excel in all aspects of student life. Academically, the chapter consistently ranks above Georgia Tech''s all-men''s average GPA, doing so the past 27 years. On the athletic fields, FIJIs are second to none, taking home the Intramural Athletic Trophy 14 out of the past 15 years. With 5 School Championships in 2010, Gamma Tau has built a strong lead in this year''s standings and looks to again take home the award in 2011. The chapter has produced leaders of numerous campus organizations, including FASET, Student Government Association, the Interfraternity Council, and the Georgia Tech Student Foundation. Finally, Gamma Tau maintains an outstanding philanthropy program. Our Habitat for Humanity fall break trip and the FIJI Run for the Kids are our largest annual philanthropic events. This fall break, Gamma Tau brought more than 120 brothers and guests to Tampa for a 3-day project with Habitat for Humanity. Our 5th Annual Fiji Run for the Kids was an overwhelming success, raising nearly $15,000 for Childrenâ€™s Healthcare of Atlanta and the Childrenâ€™s Miracle Network.\n\nIn closing, I would like to personally invite you to visit and explore our chapter. I encourage Graduate Brothers and Parents to get involved with Gamma Tau. You are always welcome at Creighton-Vail Hall and your interest is greatly appreciated. Please check the website for updates and any upcoming events. I encourage all prospective members to seek all that Gamma Tau has to offer. I hope that our brotherhood and our traditions will positively impact your life and enrich your college career.

Its Brotherhood is open to men of talent and character, but to those in particular who as gentlemen feel an affinity with one another in the common ways of college life and, moreover, in the pursuit of excellence. Such men may differ in their origins, backgrounds, and beliefs, and even be set upon diverse purposes, interests and vocations. Yet as Brothers in Phi Kappa Psi, they are vitally united in their dedication to the highest standards of intellectual, emotional, and spiritual integrity. Phi Kappa Psi encourages all its Brothers to express the true measure of their abilities and personalities through the great joy of serving others. Although the Fraternity is not in itself a religion, its ethical principles are derived from ancient wisdom and hallowed traditions that serve to advance the noble elements within human nature and thus work to overcome baseness and corruption. Phi Kappa Psi affirms its sense of fraternity to be joyous and life-giving for men capable of comprehending and accepting the meaning of its privileges, challenges and obligations. Relying on the discipline and responsibility of its individual Brothers, Phi Kappa Psi, alone of all fraternities, entrusts the governance of its Chapters and of the general Fraternity to its student leaders, whose exercise of authority is balanced and complemented by its alumni. For young men, Phi Kappa Psi helps to shape the random experiences of the college years into a more stable form in which life begins to reveal larger, clearer purposes, and friendships become firm and lasting. In the middle years the Fraternity helps to sustain mature men in the settled courses of life, strengthening their resolve and renewing their spirits through the ripening of friendship. In later life the Fraternity helps to impart the harmony and wholeness that can lead the principled man, upheld by the loyalty of his friends, to understanding and contentment. Above all, Phi Kappa Psi creates a moral order for the conduct of life that, generation after generation, unites men of honor, decency, and good will in enduring friendship and Brotherly love.', 6, 3, 'Active', '$600', '/img/default_logo.gif', 'PHI KAPPA PSI', 'http://gtphipsi.org/', 'president@gtphipsi.org', 1, '', '', 3466, 'Founders Day: February 19', 0, '0000-00-00', 'Fall', 'Day of the Week: WednesdayTime: 8:00 PMPlace: DM Smith room 11', 'Weekly', '2012-12-12', '2012-12-12', '0000-00-00'),
